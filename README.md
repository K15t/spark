# SPARK

SPARK is a framework for add-on developers for the Atlassian platform to develop, build and 
integrate Single Page Applications (SPA) into Confluence, JIRA and other Atlassian products.

With SPARK add-on developers can choose the latest, JS-based web-technologies, for example MVx 
frameworks (Angular, React, ...), build tools (Gulp, Grunt, ...), and helpers (LiveReload, ...). 
In order to integrate the SPAs in Confluence or JIRA, SPARK provides integration points to run the 
SPA in a modal dialog (as so-called Dialog App), as an Admin UI, or as a Space-level UI 
(Confluence-only).

In short, SPARK is a Single Page Application Framework for the Atlassian Platform (which also 
explains the name).
